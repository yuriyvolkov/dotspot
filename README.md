I use [Tilda](https://github.com/lanoxx/tilda/) running `tmux -2` as a terminal emulator.
Zsh powered by [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) is my default shell.
Both tmux & zsh are configured to use 256 colorspace and [base16-shell](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16-shell) built on top of [base16](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16) colorscheme.
Vim is my editor of choice ([config here](https://github.com/yuriyvolkov/pingvim)) and [base16-vim](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16-vim) provides nice looking themes for it.
